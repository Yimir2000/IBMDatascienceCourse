# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[7]:


#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
(3*4)+5


# In[8]:


#This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
200/60


# **Objectives:**
# 
# - Describe the Data Scientist's toolkit including Libraries, Packages, Data Sets, Machine Learning Models, and Big Data tools.
# - Utilize commonly used languages like Python, R, and SQL for data science tasks.
# - Demonstrate working knowledge of tools like Jupyter Notebooks and RStudio, using their various features.
# - Create and manage source code for data science using Git repositories and GitHub.
